                is less than the amount paid online via credit card, any amount paid in excess of 
                the new total amount payable shall be refunded to you by your own bank. You understand 
                and agree that in such a case, we will not process the refund on your behalf, and that 
                you are personally responsible for processing the refund with your own issuing bank.,<br>
                - If you choose to pay by credit card upon delivery (card present), the total amount 
                shall be chargeable and payable upon delivery.<br>
                <br>If any of the changes to order include promotions which are only available for 
                limited periods, any changes to your order may mean that the promotions are no longer 
                available by the time the changes are made.<br>
                <br>We reserve the right to refuse any modification in case the order has already been 
                dispatched for delivery prior to receipt of your request. <br></p>
